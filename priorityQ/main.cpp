	/*CHALLENGE*/
	
	// 1) Pull out the top() etc. = Done.
	// 2) Pull out multiple tops(), ensuring that they are being ordered correctly. = Done.
	// 3) Test out including function pointers in here too. = Done.
	// 4) Transition to multiple cpp files. = Done.
	// 5) Supply time and function reference in event class constructor. = Done.
	// 5) Including a "currentTime" we walk through time and execute the top of the queue, pop it off and continue. = Done.
	// 6) Include a PERSON. = Done.
	// 7) Assign characteristics to an instance of person at initialisation. = Done.
	// 8) Allow events (derived from class event) to act upon person. = Done.
	// 9) Run two people on one eventQ with a GlobalTime. = Done.
	// 10) Set up ages to run properly. = Done.
	// 11) DeathDates should be MINUS initialAge (convert to days too). = Done.
	// 12) Allow UpdateQ() to run -> perhaps to remote functions. = Done.
	// 13) Allow cohorts to be fired off at different times. <- CHALLENGE NOW.
	//		-> cohort constructor defines a startTime = Done.
	//		-> startTime then entered into theQ = Done.
	//		-> at the correct time theQ calls cohort->GeneratreCohort(); = Done.
	// 14) Stagger start of individuals in each cohort (spread throughout the year). = Done.
	//		-> Stagger over the period of one year. = Done.
	//		-> Make sure age / death date / events are all ON TOP of this date. = Done.
	// 15) Multiple cohorts over time. <- TARGET! = Done.
	// 16) Age structure in 1970 for time == 0. = Done.
	// 17) Allow events to be cancelled. = Done.
	// 18) Seed HIV incidence.
	//		-> Create hiv.h and Hiv(). = Done.
	//		-> Schedule HivIncidence each year. = Done.
	// 19) How to handle multiple events occuring on the same day? (non-issue).
	// 20) Allow person to be part of a COHORT. = Done.
	// 21) Scope to allow HIV to be acquired sometime during the year. = Done.
	// 22) EXPAND to include all functions of the model.
	//		-> Only allow Cd4Testing if HIV-positive. = Done.
	//		-> Ensure that I reuse as much code as possible.
	//
	//			>> NATURAL HISTORY:
	//				-> UpdateCd4Count()
	//				-> UpdateWhoStage()
	//				-> ForArtToo... ensure that disease progression occurs properly.
	//				-> Flags for checking too?
	//
	//			>> CASCADE:
	//				-> HivTesting (HCT / VCT / PICT);
	//				-> Cd4Testing (care etc.)
	//				-> Cd4Restults
	//				-> LTFU.
	//				-> Pre-ART Care Retention.
	//				-> ART Initiation.
	//				-> ART dropout.
	//
	//			>> INTERVENTIONS:
	//				-> Include 12 interventions.
	//				-> Intervention scenarios.
	//
	//			>> OUTPUT METRICS:
	//				-> DALYs between 2010 and 2030.
	//				-> Cost between 2010 and 2030.
	//				-> Care experience of those died between 2010 and 2030.
	//
	//
	//			-> An HIV-test through ANY route (each route should have a separate event but should all call a HivTest function.
	//		-> Need a more solid end point (break;) in the code
	//			-> Inclusion of HIV-related death date.
	//		-> Make more use of Cancel() for overriding competing hazards in the model.
	//		-> Costs / DALYs - can I calculate costs from the clinic perspective?

/*NOTES*/

// Consider output metrics from the model.
// Endtime of theQ may be overkill, we want everyone to die first ->> may cause longterm issues.
// Be mindful of eventual need to input parameter values / Rtools inclusion and interaction through R.
