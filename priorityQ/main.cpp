	// 1) Pull out the top() etc. = Done.
	// 2) Pull out multiple tops(), ensuring that they are being ordered correctly. = Done.
	// 3) Test out including function pointers in here too. = Done.
	// 4) Transition to multiple cpp files. = Done.
	// 5) Supply time and function reference in event class constructor. = Done.
	// 5) Including a "currentTime" we walk through time and execute the top of the queue, pop it off and continue. = Done.
	// 6) Include a PERSON. = Done.
	// 7) Assign characteristics to an instance of person at initialisation. = Done.
	// 8) Allow events (derived from class event) to act upon person.
	// 9) Allow person to be part of a COHORT.
	// 10) EXPAND to include all functions of the model.

/*NOTES*/

// Will create this model for one individual
// Transistion into defining an array of pointers (of class event) to an array of pointers (of class event Q) to corresponding eventQ's. Therefore allowing me to simulate mulitple individuals simultaneously.

// All events.h classes inherit attributes from event.h
// Ell events have an Execute() which takes NO arguments.
