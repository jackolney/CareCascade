	// 4) Transition to multiple cpp files. = Done.
	// 5) Supply time and function reference in event class constructor.
	// 5) Including a "currentTime" we walk through time and execute the top of the queue, pop it off and continue.
	// 6) EXPAND to include all functions of the model.

/*NOTES*/

// Will create this model for one individual
// Transistion into defining an array of pointers (of class event) to an array of pointers (of class event Q) to corresponding eventQ's. Therefore allowing me to simulate mulitple individuals simultaneously.
