	// 3) Test out including function pointers in here too. = Done.
	// 4) Transition to multiple cpp files. = Done.
	// 5) Supply time and function reference in event class constructor. = Done.
	// 5) Including a "currentTime" we walk through time and execute the top of the queue, pop it off and continue. = Done.
	// 6) Include a PERSON. = Done.
	// 7) Assign characteristics to an instance of person at initialisation. = Done.
	// 8) Allow events (derived from class event) to act upon person. = Done.
	// 9) Run two people on one eventQ with a GlobalTime. = Done.
	// 10) Set up ages to run properly. = Done.
	// 11) DeathDates should be MINUS initialAge (convert to days too). = Done.

/*NOTES*/

// Will create this model for one individual
// Transistion into defining an array of pointers (of class event) to an array of pointers (of class event Q) to corresponding eventQ's. Therefore allowing me to simulate mulitple individuals simultaneously.

// All events.h classes inherit attributes from event.h
// Ell events have an Execute() which takes NO arguments.

/* Rules to implement */
// 1) Require a GlobalTime variable
// 2) One eventQ -> theQ.
// 3) One cohort of people run per year
// 4) ALL persons feed events into the queue which then executes over time. All individuals run on same time, BUT do not interact (yet).
